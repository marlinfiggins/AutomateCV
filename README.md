# Automating CV and Resume creation from CSV
Author: Marlin Figgins

## To do:
- [] Work on class files for resume and CV
- [] Add to pipeline, so that .tex and .pdf end up in the outputs folder.
- [] Go through and comment code
- Write tutorial and give guide on how to use this
- [] Add general class mapping, so that I can make whichever section go to whatever entry environment I please
- [] Create "John Doe" configuration for github upload
  - `sample_config.yaml` and `sample_input.csv` and `sample_cv` and `sample_resume`
